## Overview

Split a long text into a series of tweets and post them as a thread.

## Deployment

Twitter Splitter is a web-based tool built on JavaScript, and it does not use a database, so it can be installed almost anywhere without need for running a back-end server. Simply download and unpack the latest stable release locally and open it in a browser or deploy it to a web server.

**Note: Twitter Splitter is currently under development and no stable release is yet ready.**

## Versioning

Twitter Splitter uses an unstable Master branch. The master branch is used for development, while stable versions are provided as releases. Version numbering is similar to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/); versions are listed as x.y.z., wherein z refers to bug fixes and very minor updates, y refers to minor additions and updates to functionality, and x refers to major updates or overhauls to the program that significantly impact workflow or the use of the program.
